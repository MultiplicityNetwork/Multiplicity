# Introduction
This platform is intended to achieve the ultimate membership and to quantify and qualify the greatest value of all "community". As a research and development community we are committed to systematically utilizing our intellectual and natural resources to provide the greatest opportunities, benefits and services to the greater community. In these efforts this organization was founded and dedicated to the health and welfare of all members by raising the standards of the industry, our quality of life, and our stewardship towards our global environment and its resources, ultimately multiplying the benefits to all.

Formed herein is a non-profit public benefit organization that remains to constantly sustain a prominent definition of Multiplicity in Social Physics as a Social Investment Credit Union. 

[[Multiplicity_(mathematics)|Multiplicity:]] In mathematics the multiplicity of a member of a multi-set is the number of times it appears in the multi-set. For example, the number of times a given polynomial equation has a root at a given point aka. prime factor.

[[Social]]: Relating to the interaction of members in a community.

[[Physics]]: The science that deals with matter, energy, motion, and force.

[[Social Physics]] is a field of physics that studies society as an isolated system made up of a diversity of members with prime factors of reciprocity. It's focus being to appreciate the diversity of members and to identify what is held of most common value between them and the processes by which their arrangements are configured and how they change. It defines and appreciates various levels of interaction with an emphasis on the most crucial and beneficial interactions and their overall long term effects on the greater community.

Social Physics uses Multiplicity to distinguish prime instances of reciprocity between same energy members who only differ in their reciprocity angle and momentum.  It is defined as 2R+1, where R is their reciprocity momentum.

"Set" a system that appreciates a single common value based on the classification of it's lowest energy.
"[[Multiset]]" a system that dentifies and appreciates intrinsic value at primary instances.

Social Physics defines a "multiset" as being both the qualification of reciprocity between paired members and the quantification of the potential reciprocity of unpaired members, resulting in the single filing of multiple members with a central reciprocity in multiplicity. When a member is unpaired R=0, and their value of multiplicity is 2(0)+1=1. If a member is paired R = .5 and M =2. Two paired members R=1. 

The Multiset of Multiplicity:

1) Referral: Word of Mouth, Invitation
2) Trust: To make a designation of any kind.
3) Opportunity: Volunteer
4) Sponsorship: Donation of any physical monetary instrument.
5) Ingenuity: The speculation that something is risked in hope of gain.
